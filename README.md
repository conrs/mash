My attempt at a html/css/js shell emulator, except it just does the stuff I want.

It includes a basic filesystem, though it behaves a little differently than traditional filesystems in that you can browse rss feeds or other dynamic, 3rd party content (if you're smart enough to code it in!).

It also includes some basic commands, like help, as well as a cool command (wall - send a message to all connected users). 

I wouldn't recommend coding on top of it yet, I am in the process of refactoring the way filesystem objects are made in order to make it less puke-worthy. So please, stay tuned. A lot of other refactoring is likely as well.
